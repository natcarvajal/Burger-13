# Burger-HW-13

## Purpose:

In this assignment, I created a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!). Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

## Packages Installed

* npm install express
* npm install express-handlebars
* npm install mysql
* npm install dotenv
